# Documentation screenshots

Screenshots in this directory are referenced by the guide pages and optimized by Astro during the site build.

## Reproducible capture

The desktop frontend's full Playwright flow can populate the core guide screenshots with deterministic mock data:

```bash
make screenshots
```

Capture mode writes only when `RELAY_DOCS_SCREENSHOT_DIR` is set; a normal E2E run does not
modify documentation assets.

Three rules keep the set consistent, and all three live in `captureDocsScreenshot`:

- **A 1200×780 light-theme viewport, captured at 2× device pixels** (so the files are
  2400×1560). The docs column is 800px wide, so a wider *layout* is downscaled until its UI
  text stops being readable — 1200 is the narrowest width the app still lays out normally,
  its only breakpoint being 700px. The pixel density is separate: most displays showing
  these pages have two device pixels per CSS pixel, and a 1× capture has nothing to give
  the second one. `playwright.config.ts` switches `deviceScaleFactor` to 2 only when
  `RELAY_DOCS_SCREENSHOT_DIR` is set, so ordinary E2E runs are unaffected.
- **A modal is cropped to itself**, plus 26px of the app behind it. A settings dialog inside
  a full-window shot is unreadable at page scale; on its own it renders close to 1:1. Any
  `[role="dialog"][aria-modal="true"]` is detected and cropped automatically, and a capture
  can name another element to crop to.
- **The app frame is scrolled back to the top first.** `html`, `body` and `#app` are
  `overflow: hidden`, which browsers still scroll programmatically, so an earlier
  `scrollIntoView` would otherwise push the app out of frame and fill the rest of the shot
  with page background.

## Suggested set

Each guide page benefits from at least one screenshot. To take the doc site from "good text" to "great visual", capture and save:

## Capturing tips

- Prefer the automated capture flow for screens it covers.
- Use a 1× DPI window — Retina captures bloat the page weight.
- Match the automated set: 1200×780 for a whole window, cropped tight for a dialog or a
  single panel. Narrow fragments such as `sidebar-collections.png` and `status-bar.png` are
  captured from their own element.
- Use one theme consistently within a guide. The automated set uses the light theme.
- Redact tokens / personal data in image editor before committing.
- Save as PNG. Filenames lowercase-kebab-case.

## Referencing from docs

Once a file is in this directory, import it from a guide:

```mdx
import responseViewer from '../../../assets/screenshots/response-viewer-json.png';
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';

<Image src={responseViewer} alt="JSON response with line numbers and syntax highlight" />
```

Astro's image pipeline will optimize and serve responsive variants automatically.
