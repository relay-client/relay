# @kurlo/cli

The command line of [Kurlo](https://kurlo.dev), a free, open-source desktop API client. It runs the requests and test scripts of a Kurlo workspace, and serves a workspace to AI agents as an MCP server. You don't need the desktop app installed to use it.

```bash
npm install -g @kurlo/cli
kurlo --version
```

### `EACCES: permission denied` on `npm install -g`

npm could not write to the folder that holds global packages. It happens with Node from the nodejs.org installer, which puts that folder in `/usr/local`, owned by the system. It is not specific to Kurlo, and any global package fails the same way. Either skip the install and run the CLI with `npx -y @kurlo/cli`, or move global packages into your home folder once:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.npm-global && npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
npm install -g @kurlo/cli
```

Node installed with Homebrew, Volta or nvm keeps global packages in your home folder already. Avoid `sudo npm install -g`: it works, but leaves root-owned files that break later installs.

## Connect an AI agent

Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add kurlo -- npx -y @kurlo/cli mcp --env Staging
```

Codex:

```bash
codex mcp add kurlo -- npx -y @kurlo/cli mcp --env Staging
```

Cursor, Claude Desktop and other clients with a JSON config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kurlo": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@kurlo/cli", "mcp", "--env", "Staging"]
    }
  }
}
```

The agent can list your requests and environments, run a saved request or a whole collection with its tests, and send one-off calls that use your `{{variables}}`. Secret values are sent to your API and masked as `[secret]` in everything the model sees.

With no workspace argument, `kurlo mcp` serves the workspace the desktop app has open. Pass the folder that contains `kurlo.yml` to serve a Git-backed workspace instead:

```bash
npx -y @kurlo/cli mcp ./api --env Staging
```

## Run collections in CI

```bash
npx -y @kurlo/cli run ./api --env CI --reporters cli,junit
```

The run exits non-zero when a request fails or a test does not pass.
